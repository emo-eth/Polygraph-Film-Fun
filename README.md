# Polygraph Film Fun

Fun with the Polygraph Film Dialogue dataset (dug from the page source). Adding information about critical and commercial reception according to IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes.

Fun things to note: movies that skew female score "very statistically" (p=.0002) differently (read: lower) than movies that skew male. What a concept!
